# Library-Management-System-LMS-
Library Management System 📚 A Library Management System (LMS) is a software solution designed to streamline and automate the management of a library’s resources, including books, users, borrowing, and returns. This system helps libraries maintain an efficient record-keeping process and enhances user experience.
